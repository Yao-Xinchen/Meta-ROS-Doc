# WSL

Windows Subsystem Linux, aka **WSL**, provides us a convenient way to develop on **Windows**.
You do almost the same things as on Ubuntu, except for running.

## Installation

To install WSL, visit [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

For simplicity, you can just run the following commands in **PowerShell**:

```
wsl --install
```

This will install WSL2 and Ubuntu by default.

## Usage

You would find an application Ubuntu in the start menu.
Click it to start Ubuntu, which would show a terminal.
You can use it as the one in native Ubuntu.

> This Ubuntu is very pure. There is no GUI.
