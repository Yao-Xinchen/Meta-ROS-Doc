# Dependence

To run the ROS2 program, here are several libraries required.

## ROS2

Official website: [ROS](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html)

ROS2 is the main platform we are using.

On ubuntu 20.04, the **recommended version** is ROS2 **Foxy**. This is not the latest version, but it is the most stable one on our platform.
If you are using other versions, such as Humble, you may need to install ROS by compiling from source.
